Processes:
    Get camera input
    Preprocess image for better recognition
    Find grid in camera input
    Transform perspective of grid to be 2D
    Recognise numbers on the grid using tensorflow machine learning
    Display digits on screen until solveable solution is found (give user the option to freeze digit recognition and edit the digits manually instead)
    Solve sudoku puzzle using tensorflow machine learning
    Render the newly solved digits onto the camera output

Downsample video capture for better performance?
Add option to upload image instead
Find way to deal with case where grid is tilted more than 90 degrees
add computer synthesized digits to the prediction model
